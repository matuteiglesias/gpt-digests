# GPT Digests

Pipeline for turning ChatGPT logs / units into digests and published views.

## What’s in here
- `digests_project/`: the codebase (CLI, scripts, pipeline components)
- `docs/`: documentation
- `junk/`: quarantined generated outputs / large runs (not tracked)

## Quickstart
- Inspect available commands:
  - `make -n smoke` (or `make help` if implemented)
- Typical flow is: ingest -> compute units/bags -> render/publish
